# UltimateRace Data Exploration

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on ultra-marathon race data. The project aims to uncover insights and trends related to participant demographics, race characteristics, and performance metrics in ultra-marathon events.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from "The Big Dataset of Ultra-Marathon Running," a comprehensive collection of over 7 million race records registered between 1798 and 2022.

## Motivation
This project is inspired by the "Data Analyst Portfolio Project (Exploratory Data Analysis With Python Pandas)" by ryannolandata. Drawing from their comprehensive analysis approach, this project seeks to explore the vast landscape of ultra-marathon races using similar techniques and methodologies.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preparation: Handling missing values, standardizing data types, and cleaning the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, trends, and relationships among variables.
- Statistical analysis: Investigating patterns and trends in participant demographics, race distances, and performance metrics.
- Visualization: Creating informative plots and visualizations to illustrate key findings from the analysis.

## File Structure
- `UltimateRace.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and documentation for the analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
