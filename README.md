Projects initiated by me but inspired by various sources.


Ultimate Race Cleaning through Python: -

In our project, I delve into the dynamic world of ultra-marathon running by analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing over 7 million race records spanning from 1798 to 2022. Drawing inspiration from various sources, I explore participant demographics, race attributes, and performance trends, revealing insights into the evolution of ultra-marathon events over the course of two centuries.

Analysis of Unicorn Companies Dataset: -

This project analyzes a dataset of unicorn companies, private firms valued over $1 billion as of March 2022. The analysis aims to uncover trends and insights into these high-value enterprises. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project examines the distribution of unicorn companies across industries, regions, and founding years. Additionally, it investigates the time it took for companies to achieve unicorn status and the valuation distribution among them. The findings provide valuable insights for investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, offering a deeper understanding of the factors driving the success of unicorn companies. Future directions may include longitudinal analyses and predictive modeling. Overall, the project contributes to understanding the dynamics of billion-dollar private enterprises.
